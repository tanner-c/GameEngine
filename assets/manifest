# This file contains all of the game assets so that the engine can easily access them from the filesystem
# One asset per line however an "asset" may comprise of more than one file
# Each line follows this format:
# -------------------------------
# <TYPE> <FILENAME> <ASSETNAME> <FLAGS>
# -------------------------------
#
# Note however that the filename omits file extensions. 
# See the type key below for details on how the engine discovers each asset type.
# You may also peruse asset.h and asset.cpp for additional information
# 
# SHADEVF (*.vert & *.frag) - Shader pair of vertex and fragment shaders, engine searches in ./shaders/ directory for two files that are named with <FILENAME> with the appropriate extension
